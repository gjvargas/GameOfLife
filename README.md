Game of Life

I made this game with the hexagonal spin for a Software
Studio class at MIT. I apologize for the lack of clarity
and organization in the code, but this is how we were 
required to submit the assignment. Learn about the Game
of Life here :

I've changed the rules slightly to accomodate the new
cell shapes, but the basic idea is still the same:
    - Create a configuration of dead/alive cells
    - Watch them grow and interact
    - Have Fun!

For a regular version (no hexagons), look through
previous commits.

To play simply clone the repository, then open the
html file in your browser. Enjoy!
